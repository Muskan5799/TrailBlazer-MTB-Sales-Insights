## ðŸ§® Sample DAX Logic

```DAX
-- Total Revenue
Total Revenue = SUM('AdventureWorks Sales Data 2022'[Revenue])

-- Total Orders
Total Orders = COUNTROWS('AdventureWorks Sales Data 2022')

-- Profit Margin %
Profit Margin % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - SUM('AdventureWorks Sales Data 2022'[Total_Cost]), 
    [Total Revenue]
)

-- Return Rate
Return Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM('AdventureWorks Returns Data'[Return Quantity]), 
    [Total Orders]
)
