## Data Sources

The dataset is organized into **fact and dimension tables** to support analysis and reporting:            
**Fact Tables** → Sales, Internet Sales, Reseller Sales                         
**Dimension Tables** → Products, Customers, Date, Geography, Sales Territories

This star-schema structure enables efficient **data modeling, relationships, and KPI calculations** within Power BI, ensuring accurate and interactive dashboard insights.

#### Data Model (Schema)  
Here’s the schema used in the dashboard:  

## Data Cleaning Process
- Removed redundant fields like GUIDs and internal system codes to streamline the dataset.              
- Addressed missing values across key tables (Customer, Product, Sales) by either imputing or excluding based on relevance.                
- Standardized data types—ensured dates, currency, and text fields were correctly formatted for analysis.              
- Unified category labels (e.g., “MTB” standardized to “Mountain Bike”) to avoid filter mismatches.
- Created calculated fields such as Profit = Sales - Cost and Average Order Value = Revenue / Orders to support core metrics.

## 🧮 Sample DAX Logic

```DAX
-- Total Revenue
Total Revenue = SUM('AdventureWorks Sales Data 2022'[Revenue])

-- Total Orders
Total Orders = COUNTROWS('AdventureWorks Sales Data 2022')

-- Profit Margin %
Profit Margin % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - SUM('AdventureWorks Sales Data 2022'[Total_Cost]), 
    [Total Revenue]
)

-- Return Rate
Return Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM('AdventureWorks Returns Data'[Return Quantity]), 
    [Total Orders]
)
